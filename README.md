This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked off-by-one error in Java's while loop using post-increment. The original code (`Bug.java`) exhibits the error, and the corrected version (`BugSolution.java`) provides a solution.  This example is useful for illustrating the importance of carefully considering increment/decrement operators' placement within loop conditions.
